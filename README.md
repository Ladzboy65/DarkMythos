# DarkMythos

Imagine you're excavating an area for a new house and suddenly a book appears and thunder booms from the sky. You've just found a lost spell book but only the gods know what kind of spell book it will be.

Will it be Demeter's Spell of Botanical Maturity? Hephaestus' Spell of Diamond Touch? Feather Touch or Creature Thief? Or any of dozens more?

Pick up your spell book quickly before someone else takes it, and store it for later. When you're ready to use it, follow its instructions on use but **beware**: The Gods have also *cursed* some of the spell books but the only way to know is to activate the spells. 

If you do find a cursed spell book, pray that it's a minor curse - like a few health points lost or poison. For the truly unlucky, your spell book may contain the ultimate curse - a brutal death. 

## Gods
